# Pandemic-Model

This is a functioning GUI-based pandemic simulator with various features:

- Variables (Population, Lockdown Factor, Disease Duration, Asymptomacity & Mortality) that can be modified to mirror real-life conditions
- 5 read-only properties (Time, Economic Damage, Dead Count, Infected Count & Recovered Count) that aim to predict outcomes based on variables entered
- A mouse listener allows the user to infect as many people as they wish.
- The GUI is launched by running the Pandemic class.
